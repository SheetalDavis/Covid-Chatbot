  utter_about_covid:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals
      or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are     known to cause respiratory
      infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle
      East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
      The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
  utter_general_tips:
  - text: Contact nearest healthcare facility for a covid test. Take care
  utter_types_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
      or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
      become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
      people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
      Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
      difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
      serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
      medical attention.
  utter_spread_details:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing
      ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
      findings.
  utter_prevent_covid:
  - text: Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
      Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have
      seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
      in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable
      so check regularly for the latest news.
  utter_about_antibiotics:
  - text: No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
      infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics
      should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should
      only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.
  utter_about_vaccine:
  - text: Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
      to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care
      to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most
      patients recover thanks to supportive care.Possible vaccines and some specific
      drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical
      trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent
      and treat COVID-19.The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
      COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend
      of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
      people who are coughing or sneezing
